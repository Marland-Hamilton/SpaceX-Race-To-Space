# üöÄ Race to Winning Space ‚Äì Predicting SpaceX Landings  

This project explores SpaceX‚Äôs Falcon 9 launch data to predict the likelihood of a successful first stage landing. Since the ability to reuse rockets is critical to lowering space travel costs, predicting landings provides insight into SpaceX‚Äôs competitive advantage in the commercial space race.  

## üìä Project Overview  
- **Goal:** Predict whether the Falcon 9 first stage will successfully land.  
- **Dataset:** SpaceX launch records from 2006‚Äì2020, provided via Coursera and SpaceX API.  
- **Tech Stack:**  
  - Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)  
  - SQL for data queries and cleaning  
  - Jupyter Notebook for analysis and modeling  

## üîç Methodology  
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
   - Pulled data from SpaceX API and a provided dataset.  
   - Cleaned missing values, standardized launch outcomes, and engineered features.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyzed launch success rates across years, rocket configurations, and locations.  
   - Visualized correlations between payload, orbit type, and landing outcomes.  

3. **Model Development**  
   - Applied classification models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines.  
   - Compared performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.  

4. **Results**  
   - Identified key factors influencing landing success.  
   - Achieved strong predictive performance with the best model.  

## üìå Key Findings  
- Payload mass and orbit type strongly impact landing success.  
- Launch site influences probability of successful landings.  
- Machine learning models can provide reliable predictions for future missions.
